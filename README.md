# wp-simpletheme
This is a SUPER simple theme to use with WordPress and builders like Oxygen Builder and Elementor PRO. The point of this theme is to remove all other code other than JUST the basics that are needed, plus a some simple functions. 

Note: if you are using Oxygen Builder, your themes are NOT used at all. Oxygen Builder replaces the contents of your theme completely. Using this theme elimnates the need for managine theme updates. The functions and css of your theme are not output, and must be added using a plugin.
